### Dev log:
> Manheim, Pickles completed. Simply upon requesting a vehicle brand, returned to you will be a list of vehicles each including information containing the title, the link to sale, and image.

> Interact with the service via discord, request information via a discord bot programmed with Discord.py, and recieve extensive sale returns via discord webhook's.

> Development on 24/7 vehicle scout service is in fruition, just bought a Raspberry Pi 5, in hopes to host this locally!

### To do:
> Extend the scope of web-crawler to various other used car vendors including: Facebook marketplace via their developer api, Carsales.com.au, Grays.com and Gumtree.com.au!

> Have the service hosted via my Raspberry Pi 5 server, and have a full-stack portal hosted in conjunction with torkay.com that'll connect to my local server in order to crawl the web.

> Be able to create accounts, save listings to that account, and keep fingers in each listing to discover if they've sold yet and delete them from the server.
